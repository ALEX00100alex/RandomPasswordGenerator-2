# Random Password Generator

A random password generator using javascript

## Background 

This is my first attempt at building a random password generator, incorporating the following elements:
1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. Javascript 

## Code Style

This website is built with HTML and CSS code, with the primary code created using javascript  

## Functionality

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user will be asked if they want to include the following elements into their password:

1. Uperrcase letters
2. Lowercase letters
3. Numbers
4. Special characters

The user can choose any combination of these elements. The website will then prompt the user for password length (between 8 and 128 characters).

The random password is then generated in the box titled "Your Secure Password".

## Screenshots
